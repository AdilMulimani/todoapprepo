1)Colors node.js package
The "colors" package in Node.js is a utility library used to add color and style to console output in terminal environments.
It allows developers to easily apply colors, background colors, styles (such as bold or underline), and other formatting to text printed to the console.

Using the "colors" package can be particularly helpful when debugging or logging messages to the console,
 as it allows developers to visually distinguish between different types of output
 or highlight important information.

Example:console.log("Adil".red)
