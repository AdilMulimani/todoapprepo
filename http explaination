//getting the Node.js package of http to create a server
const http = require("http")

//creating a server locally
//create server method asks for a callback function
http.createServer((req, res)=>{

    //HTTP headers are components of the HTTP protocol
   // that are sent between a client (such as a web browser) and a server.
    //They provide additional information about the request or the response,
     // helping both the client and the server understand how to handle the communication.
    res.writeHead(200,{
        'Content-type':'text/plain'
    });
  // res.end() method is used to end the response process and send the response to the client.
  //This method takes an optional data parameter
  //that allows you to include data in the response body before ending the response.
    res.end("Hello World");
})
//The listen method is called on the server object returned by createServer.
//It starts the server and makes it listen on the specified port (3000 in this case).
//Once the server is successfully started, the provided callback function is invoked,
//which logs a message to the console indicating that the server is connected and listening on port 3000.
    .listen(3000,()=>{
    console.log("Connected to server on port 3000");
});
